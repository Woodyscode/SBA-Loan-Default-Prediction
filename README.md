## üìñ About the Project

This project applies a Random Forest classifier to predict loan default for SBA loans using historical data. It features:

* A real data model trained on SBA public loan data
* A synthetic data model trained on the same data augmented with estimated financial features
* A Streamlit dashboard for visualizing results and exploring model performance

## üöÄ Motivation

This project represents my growth from beginner to builder. It combines my interests in machine learning, finance, and product development into something practical and valuable. I wanted to create a solution that could help analysts and lenders better understand borrower risk, while also continuing to improve my own technical and communication skills in the process.

Whether you're a researcher, an aspiring quant, or just curious about data-driven decision making, I hope this project offers insight and value.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sba-loan-predictor.git
   cd sba-loan-predictor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the models:

   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

4. Run the dashboard:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üß† Usage

Once launched, the dashboard allows users to:

* Toggle between models (real vs synthetic features)
* View feature importances
* Compare metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Understand the drivers of SBA loan defaults

## ‚úÖ Tests

Basic model validation metrics are printed to the console during training:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score

You can extend this with unit tests using `pytest` or `unittest` in the future.
